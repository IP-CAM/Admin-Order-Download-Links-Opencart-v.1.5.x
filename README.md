Admin Order Downloads Links for OpenCart
vQmod XML extension

---

DESCRIPTION

What: adds the ability for the Admin User to download digital files ("Downloads") on an Order.

Where: links to download digital files are added to "Order Downloads" section of Admin Order Info page

How: In the default OpenCart install, the Admin User can NOT download digital files linked to a Product from the Admin dashboard. The only way the Admin User can access them directly is via the web host or an FTP client. This extension adds a hyperlink to the "Filename" of the "Order Downloads" on the Admin Order Info page, which allows the Admin User to securely download these files DIRECTLY with a single mouse click.
